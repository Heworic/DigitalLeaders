## My Digital Leaders Application
Hi there! I’m Chor Wei, and I’d like to apply for the position of a digital leader. I think that I am a good suit for the position, as I am capable and familiar with technology, and I have design skills that were stated was in demand during the Thursday introduction.

### What will I bring to the team of Digital Leaders?
I’m interested and adept at working with technology and python programming and I know my way around design, and even my previously atrocious illustration and art skills have improved after taking IGCSE. I know and can work well with some members of the Digital Leaders team as I am good friends with some of them and can communicate and collaborate effectively with people in general. My naturally diplomatic disposition means that I can also resolve conflicts well.

### Why I want to become a Digital Leader
By joining the Digital Leaders, I seek to enhance my presentation and public speaking skills, be more involved with the school and understand more about its running and decision making, bolster my (admittedly lackluster) social experience and social skills, learn how to effectively communicate, manage, apply technology to my learning, and lead, and contribute in our school's development along the way.
